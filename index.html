            <h1>About Joy Daudu</h1>
            <p>
                Well I am currently a virtual geophysical researcher and analyst where I contributed to the CIBR research for gold in some part of Jigawa and environs. I also have analysed some magnetic and gravitational data as well as digitized maps for areas around Gombe, Oyo, Bauchi and Maiduguri; with the help of ARCGIS and Oasis Montaj applications. Before that, I had worked as a <em>class room instructor and trained as an agriculturist</em>. And while I really enjoy what I did, I'd love the chance to explore my programming interest in a much deeper way by learning and active participation which is why I'm so excited about this oportunity with Altschool Africa.
